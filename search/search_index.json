The rise of very large metadata and eventually consistent cloud data lakes (S3 specifically) drove the need for an updated model around metadata managmeent. Where consistent directory listings in HDFS used to be sufficient, there were many features lacking. This includes snapshotting, consistency and fast planning. Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake were both created to help alleviate those problems. For more insight into why we created Nessie, you can read the founding blog post by one of Nessie\u2019s creators. Inspiration \u00b6 The Iceberg format (as well as the Delta Lake format) relies on a set of metadata files stored with (or near) the actual data tables. This allows Iceberg to fulfill the same role as the Hive Metastore for transactions without the need for expensive metadata scans or centralized planning (see Iceberg performance ). This includes things such as partitioning (including hidden partitions), schema migrations, appends and deletes. It does however require a pointer to the active metadata set to function. This pointer allows the Iceberg client to acquire and read the current schema, files and partitions in the dataset. Iceberg currently relies on the Hive metastore or hdfs to perform this role. The requirements for this root pointer store is it must hold (at least) information about the location of the current up to date metadata file and it must be able to update this location atomically. In Hive this is accomplished by locks and in hdfs by using atomic file swap operations. These operations don\u2019t exist in eventually consistent cloud object stores, necessitating a Hive metastore for cloud data lakes. The Nessie system is designed to store the root metadata pointer and perform atomic updates to this pointer, obviating the need for a Hive metastore. Removing the need for a Hive metastore simplifies deployment and broadens the reach of tools that can work with Iceberg tables. The above is specific to how Iceberg behaves however Delta Lake operates in a near identical way. The Nessie service is a lightweight Java based REST API server. It uses a standard optimistic locking strategy to ensure atomic transactions. This relies on every operation carrying an expected hash state for the store and allows for a very light weight and scalable implementation. The implementation uses configurable authentication (eg IAM on AWS, JWT elsewhere) and a configurable backend (currently supporting DynamoDB on AWS) and uses the optimistic locking features of cloud based key value stores to ensure scalability across servers. This architecture allows for Nessie to run in a docker container, as a Lambda function or in a number of other configurations.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"develop/architecture/#architecture","text":"Nessie builds on the recent ecosystem developments around table formats.

Today, this kernel is built on top of DynamoDB. The commit kernel is the heart of Nessie\u2019s oeprations and enables it to provide lightweight creation of new tags and branches, merges, rebases all with a very high concurrent commit rate. Data Structures \u00b6 Nessie\u2019s commit kernel works with two tables: the refs table and the objects table. Refs Table The refs table will have objects equal to the current number of active tags and branches. This will generally be small (10s-1000s). All commits run through this table and thus the writes and reads of this table should be provisioned based on the amount of read and write operations expected per second. Since the dataset is small, sharding will be unlikely to happen on this table. Scans are regularly done on this table. Objects Table The objects table stores data structures associated with commits and will be a small multiple of the number of objects and version tracked in Nessie. Assume approximately number objects x active versions x 4 (write multiplier) to get a rough sense of the number of 4kb objects that Nessie will be storing in the objects table. Scans are not done on this table except in the case of rare Garbage Collection operations. Space Consumption: The data stored in DynamoDB is designed to largely fit within DynamoDBs 4kb read size unit (and 4x the write size unit). This true for objects in both the refs table and the objects table. At a high level, Nessie\u2019s commit kernel breaks keyspace into a 3 level tree and each operation restates some portion of that tree. Each level of the tree is identified by sha256 20 byte hash value, which is used to as a storage key in DynamoDB. Commit operations are atomic and interact with branch objects using a data structure akin to a 151-way striped locked. This data structure is updated using patch conditional operations against DynamoDB. To maintain linear history, the branch object also maintains a commit log that works with the striped lock to make history clear and consistent. Performance \u00b6 The design target for the Nessie commit kernel was to support 100,000 tables with each table mutating every 5 minutes. This equates to ~300 operations/second.

We evaluated Git directly, implemented a version that used JGit (used by tools like Gerrit and Eclipse) as well as explored the capabilities of GitHub, Azure Git and AWS Git. What we saw was a fairly expensive operation. Typically, a single commit operation took on the order of a few seconds [check out this blog post on git commit times]. Scale 100s MB Unconstrained While there are [msft link, pallantir link] examples of larger or higher performance Git repositories, in general. Git repositories are fairly small in size. Things like Git LFS were created to help accommodate this but given the nature of clones, large repositories are frowned upon.

Committer Human Human & Machine Git was designed for human time: commits happen 100-1000s of times a day, not 100x per second. Data in many systems is changing very frequently (especially when you consider a large number of tables). These systems are frequently driven by automated scripts Objects Files Tables & Views Nessie is focused on tracking versions of tables using a well-known set of open table formats. Nessie\u2019s capabilities are integrated into the particular properties of these formats. Git is focused on the generalized problem of tracking arbitrary files (buckets of bytes). Nessie on Git? \u00b6 While we describe the reasoning and differences above, we actually support running Nessie on top of Git. In fact, the first version of Nessie was built on top of Git. Once implemented, we then evaluated it against one of our key design criterion. This design criterion was to support commits in the situation where there are 100,000 tables and each table is changing every 5 minutes. (For reference, the 5 minutes comes from community guidance on commit speed per table for Iceberg. The 100,000 tables comes from various users we\u2019ve worked with before.) The math for this comes out to ~333 commits/second. 333 Commits/second? \u00b6 Using the design goal above, we looked at the major Git service providers to evaluate their performance. We saw an average commit turn-around speed of 1-5/s for most services (GitHub, Azure Git, AWS Git, etc). Worse case commit latency were >20s for a single commit. Given this initial result, things were not looking good. We took one more attempt to try to achieve the performance requirements using Git. We built a custom storage mechanism for the awesome JGit library . This showed better promise, providing up to 20/commits second when run against DynamoDB. However, it was still insufficient. As such, we ultimately built our own commit kernel to power Nessie. In Nessie, we continue to include an experimental backing store built on top of JGit.

Nessie enhances the following table formats with version control techniques: Apache Iceberg Tables ( more ) Delta Lake Tables ( more ) Hive Metastore Tables ( more ) SQL Views ( more ) Basic Concepts \u00b6 Nessie is heavily inspired by Git. The main concepts Nessie exposes map directly to Git concepts . In most cases, you simply need to replace references of files and directories in Git with Tables in Nessie. The primary concepts in Nessie are: Commit: Consistent snapshot of all tables at a particular point in time Branch: Human-friendly reference that a user can add commits to. Tag: Human-friendly reference that points to a particular commit. Hash: Hexadecimal string representation of a particular commit Out of the box, Nessie starts with a single branch called main that points to the beginning of time. A user can immediately start adding tables to that branch. For example (in pseudo code): $ create t1 ... $ insert 2 records into t1 ... $ create t2 ... $ insert 2 records into t2 ... A user can then use the Nessie CLI to view the history of the main branch. You\u2019ll see that each operation in Spark was automatically recorded as a commit within Nessie: $ nessie log hash4 t2 data added hash3 t2 created hash2 t1 data added hash1 t1 created A user can then create a new tag referencing this point in time.

Data and Metadata \u00b6 Nessie does not make copies of your underlying data. Instead, it works to version separate lists of files associated with your dataset. Whether using Spark, Hive or some other tool, each mutation operation you do will add or delete one or more files from the definition of your table. Nessies keeps tracks of which files are related to each of your tables at every point in time and then allows you to recall those as needed. Scale & Performance \u00b6 Nessie is built for very large data warehouses. Nessie supports millions of tables and 1000s of commits/second. Because Nessie builds on top of Iceberg and Delta Lake, each table can have millions of files. As such, Nessie can support data warehouses several magnitudes larger than the largest in the world today. This is possible in large part due to the separation of transaction management (Nessie) from table metadata management (Iceberg and Delta Lake). Technology \u00b6 Nessie can be deployed in multiple ways and is composed primarily of the Nessie service, which exposes a set of REST APIs and a simple browse UI. This service works with multiple libraries to expose Nessie version control capabilities to common data management technologies. Nessie was built as a Cloud native technology and is designed to be highly scalable, performant and resilient. Built on Java and leveraging Quarkus , it is compiled to a GraalVM native image that starts in less than 20ms. This makes Nessie work very well in docker and FaaS environments. Nessie has a pluggable storage backend and comes pre-packaged with support for DynamoDB and local storage. License and Governance \u00b6 Nessie is Apache-Licensed and built in an open source, consensus-driven GitHub community. Nessie was originally conceived and built by engineers at Dremio .

Tag: Human-friendly reference that points to a particular commit. Hash: Hexadecimal string representation of a particular commit Out of the box, Nessie starts with a single branch called main that points to the beginning of time. A user can immediately start adding tables to that branch. For example (in pseudo code): $ create t1 ... $ insert 2 records into t1 ... $ create t2 ... $ insert 2 records into t2 ...

Each management service can be scheduled and Nessie reports the outcome of each scheduled operation. Scheduled operations require that Nessie have access to a Spark cluster to complete those operations and many of them are distributed compute operations. Info Table management services are currently in progress and are not yet included in a released version of Nessie. Garbage Collection \u00b6 Since Nessie is maintaining many different versions of metadata and data-pointers simultaneously, you must rely on Nessie to clean up old data. Nessie calls this garbage collection. Garbage collection policies are configurable and can be either destructive or instructive. To configure garbage collection, you must set the following settings: Collection Types \u00b6 Collection Modes Notes Unreferenced Data Instructive or Destructive Deletes any objects that haven\u2019t been directly referenced by a tag or branch for 30 days. Unreferenced Commit Deletes internal Nessie objects that are no longer referenced Destructive Unreferenced Metadata Deletes metadata objects that are no longer referenced 1 Referenced Commit & Metadata Deletes historical commit information that is in a valid commit tree but older than a certain date Danger Because of the nature of data sizes, Nessie treats any historical commit as \u201cunreferenced\u201d if it is not directly referenced by a tag or branch. This is very different than traditional Git . If you want to also maintain historical versions of data beyond your garbage collection time, you should leverage Time-based AutoTagging (below). Time-based AutoTagging \u00b6 Nessie works against data based on a commit timeline. In many situations, it is useful to capture historical versions of data for analysis or comparison purposes. As such, you can configure Nessie to AutoTag (and auto-delete) using a timestamp based naming scheme. When enabled, Nessie will automatically generate and maintain tags based on time so that users can refer to historical data using timestamps as opposed to commits. This also works hand-in-hand with the Nessie garbage collection process by ensuring that older data is \u201creferenced\u201d and htus available for historical analysis. Currently there is one AutoTagging policy. By default, it creates the following tags: Hourly tags for the last 25 hours Daily tags for the last 8 days Weekly tags for the last 6 weeks Monthly tags for the last 13 months Yearly tags for the last 3 years Tags are automatically named using a date/ prefix and a zero-extended underscore based naming scheme. For example: date/2019_09_07_15_50 would be a tag for August 7, 2019 at 3:50pm. Warning AutoTags are automatically deleted once the policy rolls-over.

This is enabled across an unlimited number of tables. A user can view a commit log either through the UI or by using the Nessie CLI. Operations against each table are listed along with timestamp, user and helpful information about the operation. Cross-Table Transactions \u00b6 Nessie is the first technology to provide an open facility for cross-table transactions within your data lake. There are two ways that this can be accomplished: Via Branches: Because Nessie allows branches to be created and then reassigned, a sequence of commits on one branch can be exposed as a single consistent view to other users through the use of a merge operation. This allows use of systems that don\u2019t have internal cross-table transaction support to still control the visibility of connected changes. Single Commits: Nessie allows a single commit operation to include many object changes simultaneously. While Nessie operations internally use this capability, tools will need to be enhanced to take advantage of this powerful new capability. START TRANSACTION.. COMMIT \u00b6 The Nessie community is working with tool developers to introduce traditional data warehouse cross-table transactions. Nessie\u2019s catalog implementations already support the underlying capability of multi-table transactions. Isolation Levels \u00b6 Nessie exposes APIs to support three-levels of isolation: Read Committed, Repeated Read and Serialized. By supporting the recording of reads as part of a commit (via the Unchanged operation), tools can introduce full per operation serialized isolation. This is a transaction mode that has been traditionally limited to OLTP systems and unavailable to OLAP systems and data warehouses 1 . Info While Nessie exposes the necessary primitives to support configurable isolation, work still needs to be done with tool developers to ensure those tools expose these capabilities. As those integrations progress, we\u2019ll include more information about them here. At the moment, most tools operate in either Read Committed (Iceberg when calling refresh, Delta Lake) or Repeated Read (HMS Bridge operations, Iceberg when avoiding calls to refresh). Read Committed (Optimistic) \u00b6 Read Each time metadata for a table is retrieved, the latest version of that ref for the that current branch is exposed. Ownership A transaction only needs to be created on the client. There is not concept of a long-lived transaction. Write Safe writes are allowed. How Client goes to server to retrieve latest version of data for each operation Repeated Read (Optimistic) \u00b6 Read When a transaction is started, a ref is turned into a specific commit id. All metadata retrieved is locked to this hash or later, as long as future hashes have not changed any table already read. Ownership A transaction only needs to be created on the client. There is no concept of a long-lived transaction on the server. Write Safe writes are allowed. Unsafe writes fail. How Client resolves commit hash on first read and uses that for all subsequent operations. Note: this is stricter than the formal definition of repeatable read since that will allow new records to also be viewed on a second operation within the same transaction. However, both implementations are of similar complexity and a stricter form of repeated read seems easier to understand. Serializable (Optimistic) \u00b6 Read When a transaction is started, a ref is turned into a specific commit id. During the transaction, a recording of all read tables is recorded. Ownership A transaction only needs to be created on the client. There is no concept of a long-lived transaction on the server. Write All tables touched as part of the read operations must be in the same state when the commit operation is attempted. If they are not, the write operation is rejected. This is done internally via the Unchanged operation. How Client resolves commit hash on first read and uses that for all subsequent operations. Serializable transactions allow one to do guaranteed exactly once operations. For example- move all this data from table1 to table2. At the end of this operation there is a guarantee that any operations done against table1 will either show up in table2 or fail to apply to table1 (true before & after). Pessimistic Locking \u00b6 Currently, all three isolation models are supported only via optimistic locking. In the future, it is likely that we will also add support for pessimistic locking. To support pessimistic locking, transaction state must be held by the Nessie service as opposed to Nessie clients requiring a more formal protocol around start transaction, commit transaction with relevant timeouts, deadlock detection and cancellation capabilities. Lock Coarseness and Resolution \u00b6 Nessie maintains state and locks at table granularity. If a conflict is found at the table level, Nessie will either reject the operation or delegate the operation to the underlying table format to see if further conflict resolution can occur.

These types of formats rely on a transaction arbitrator to decide the order of operations within a table. Nessie developers have named this operation a \u201croot pointer store\u201d (or RPS).

This decision needs to be maintained via a check-and-set operation about what the current state of a table is. Root Pointer Store \u00b6 Each table format provides at least one RPS facility. Existing RPS models include: RPS by convention: E.g. \u201conly one writer is allowed\u201d RPS by consistent fileSystem: E.g. one file can be created with a certain name RPS by external locking: E.g. calling Hive Metastore lock apis Nessie formalizes and extends the concept of an RPS.

It allows you to run a vanilla Hive Metastore server that is enhanced to also support Nessie capabilities. This can be used to expose Nessie functionality to Hive or any Hive metastore compatible tool (such as AWS Athena ). Info HMS here stands for Hive Metastore and is not related to the HMS Queen Elizabeth or her sisterships. How It Works \u00b6 The HMS Bridge implements a new RawStore for the Hive metastore. The RawStore is an interface that Hive exposes to provide alternative backing storage systems. Typically, people use the default option of ObjectStore interacting with traditional relational databases. The HMS Bridge packages the Nessie REST client and leverages the Nessie service to provide versioning capabilities for Hive databases, tables and partitions. HMS Bridge Modes \u00b6 The HMS Bridge can run in two ways: Pure Nessie In this mode, all tables are Nessie based and no backing relational store is required. This is appropriate for new deployments. Delegation Mode In this mode the HMS Bridge can enhance your existing Hive Metastore. In this mode, your Hive metastore works as it does without the HMS Bridge for all but a set of whitelisted databases. When you interact with those whitelisted databases, you\u2019ll have Nessie\u2019s versioning capabilities. This allows people who are already using Hive metastore extensively to continue to do so while still taking advantage of Nessie\u2019s capabilities for some tables and databases. Setup \u00b6 Currently, the HMS Bridge works with Hive 2.x and Hive 3.x. To get started, do the following steps: Install Hive (2.3.7, 3.1.2, or similar). The easiest way is to download a tarball from Apache . Grab a generated artifact from GitHub and copy into the Hive lib folder: Hive 2: cp nessie-hms-hive2-0.1.jar lib Hive 3: cp nessie-hms-hive3-0.1.jar lib Add the following properties to hive-site.xml or similar: <property> <name> hive.metastore.rawstore.impl </name> <description> The specific Nessie store for Hive, see list below. </description> <value> org.projectnessie.Hive2NessieRawStore </value> </property> <property> <name> nessie.url </name> <description> The HTTP endpoint for the Nessie service. </description> <value> http://localhost:19120/api/v1 </value> </property> <property> <name> nessie.dbs </name> <description> A whitelist of databases that should be managed by Nessie, only relevant when using Delegation mode. `$nessie` admin database is always whitelisted. </description> <value> nessiedb,mynessiedb,git4data </value> </property> Class Hive Version Mode org.projectnessie.Hive2NessieRawStore Hive 2 Nessie Only org.projectnessie.DelegatingHive2NessieRawStore Hive 2 Nessie + Legacy Tables org.projectnessie.Hive3NessieRawStore Hive 3 Nessie Only org.projectnessie.DelegatingHive3NessieRawStore Hive 3 Nessie + Legacy Tables Start the metastore with bin/hive --service metastore Start working with Hive Metastore using HMS Bridge. If you\u2019ve chosen delegation mode, your existing Hive Metastore tables will continue to exist. Note In Hive 3 there is something called Hive Metastore \u201cStandalone\u201d mode. This was designed to try to support Kafka schema registry scenarios. It does not come packaged with sufficient capabilities to work as a Hive Metastore for querying purposes. To use Hive in this context you need a complete Hive install (the same as using Hive Metastore without Nessie). Use \u00b6 What\u2019s Supported \u00b6 Because Nessie Tables provide a set of new capabilities beyond what Hive has traditionally done, only a subset of Hive features are available with these tables. (If you are running in Nessie + Legacy mode, this only applies to Nessie tables, legacy tables will continue to operate as they do today.) These features currently include: CREATE, ALTER and DROP of: databases external tables views Inserting data into an empty table ADD and DROP for partitions Altering table properties Note: When using external tables with HMS Bridge, the tables must be created with the \u201cimmutable=true\u201d property. Nessie reject tables that are not configured with this property. This property does not mean the tables are immutable. What it does is disable Hive from mutating a tables state without informing the Hive metastore. This guarantees that Hive versions are maintained correctly. Query Semantics \u00b6 By default, Hive will work with the default branch configured in Nessie. You can do normal operations against your Hive metastore and Nessie will behave just like a traditional metastore. However, under the covers, Nessie is versioning all changes to your Hive metastore. This allows to do more fancy things as well. Because Hive does not natively support Branching and Tags, Nessie presents a pseudo-database called \u2018$nessie\u2019 which can be used within a HiveQL context to: * list available branches & tags * change the default ref for your session * create tags and branches List available branches and tags \u00b6 You can list available named references within Nessie by listing the tables in the $nessie database. hive> SHOW TABLES IN `$nessie` OK main dev ... Create New Branch or Tag \u00b6 To create a branch or tag, you will use CREATE VIEW syntax along with a dummy SQL query. The name of the view will be the new named reference. You can optionally provide type and ref parameters to further define your new object. ||property||description|| | type |Defaults to branch . Whether to create a named reference of type tag or branch | | ref |Defaults to the head of the current default branch (typically main ). Can be set to either a hash, branch or tag. If set to a tag or branch, resolves the named reference to a hash for creation.| Example uses: # create a new branch called my_new_branch pointing to the HEAD of the current ref context. hive> CREATE VIEW `$nessie`.my_new_branch AS SELECT 1; OK # create a new tag called my_new_tag pointing to the current tip of the default branch. hive> CREATE VIEW `$nessie`.my_new_tag TBLPROPERTIES(\"type\"=\"tag\") AS SELECT 1; OK # create a new tag called my_new_specific_tag that points to the reference \"abcd...\" hive> CREATE VIEW `$nessie`.my_new_specific_tag TBLPROPERTIES(\"type\"=\"tag\", \"ref\"=\"abcd...\") AS SELECT 1; OK Note: The SELECT 1 in the queries above is arbitrary and only serves to allow Hive to understand the HiveQL operation and then delegate it to Nessie. Any valid SQL can be provided there and will be thrown away, not stored. If you are running in Hive 2, it doesn\u2019t support creating views of queries without a FROM clause. In those cases, you\u2019ll need to use some other dummy statement such as SELECT * from <known table> LIMIT 1 . Set Your Context \u00b6 To change the context of the environment your session is working within, you will alter the $nessie database. You can set the default context to any valid Nessie reference. For example: hive> ALTER DATABASE `$nessie` SET DBPROPERTIES (\"ref\"=\"my_special_branch\") OK Once you change context, all read operations will default to that context for the life of that session. All write operations will also be done within that context. Querying across multiple contexts \u00b6 You can use absolute references to query across context. You do this by appending @<refname> to the table you want to query. For example, if you want to see all records in a table from yesterday and now, you might write a query such as: hive> SELECT * from t1 UNION ALL `t1@yesterday` OK This can be used to directly access any available reference within Nessie hive> SELECT * from `t1@prod_data_branch` UNION ALL `t1@my_special_tag` UNION ALL `t1@2019-12-25` OK Note You can only use absolute references (t1@ ) for SELECT queries. For mutation operations (such as CREATE/ALTER/DROP), you must first assign the context that you want to do the operation within. IOW, absolute references are read-only. Not Yet Supported \u00b6 Because Nessie has a special way of representing the data, the following types of objects and operations are not currently supported: Grants, role, privileges Statistics Functions Tokens Notifications Constraints and referential integrity (primary/foreign keys) File Management \u00b6 When using Nessie with Hive, you must rely on Nessie\u2019s garbage collection system in order to clean up files that are no longer referenced. Because there may be historical versions of tables pointing to specific files, using an external process to delete those files when not instructed/managed by Nessie will result in historical queries returning partial datasets. Because of this, the following tables types are unlikely to ever be supported by Nessie\u2019s versioning management system: Internal tables (Hive doesn\u2019t import metastore about changes) External tables without the \u201cimmutable=true\u201d property. Additionally, when creating a new external table, Nessie will always prepend the table\u2019s location with a randomly generated Guid. This ensures the following set of operations still maintain history and work as expectd: hive> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE t1 (a int, b int) PARTITIONED BY (c int) TBLPROPERTIES (\"immutable\"=\"true\"); OK hive> INSERT TABLE t1 PARTITION(c) SELECT 1 AS a, 1 AS b,1 AS c UNION ALL SELECT 2,2,2 UNION ALL SELECT 3,3,3; ... OK hive> CREATE VIEW `$nessie`.original AS SELECT 1; OK hive> DROP TABLE t1; OK hive> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE t1 (a int, b int) PARTITIONED BY (c int) TBLPROPERTIES (\"immutable\"=\"true\"); OK hive> INSERT TABLE t1 PARTITION(c) SELECT 10 AS a, 10 AS b, 1 AS c; ... OK In this situation, Nessie\u2019s versioning is in full effect. If I query t1 , I will see the record with a=10. If I query t1@original , I will see the records with a=[1,2,3]. Without Nessie\u2019s automatic prefixing, default Hive behavior would actually lead to an exception when the second insertion is done since it would find a file already existing on the path of the default external table.","title":"Hive"},{"location":"tools/hive/#hive","text":"Nessie provides offers an optional component called the HMS Bridge Service.

These include: Iceberg client \u00b6 Nessie works seamlessly with Iceberg in Spark2 and Spark3. Nessie is implemented as a custom iceberg catalog and therefore supports all features available to any Iceberg client. This includes Spark structured streaming, Presto and Flink. See the iceberg docs for more info. We update soon with instructions to use these technologies with Nessie. Note You can follow along interactively in a Jupyter notebook by following the instructions here . To access Nessie from a spark cluster make sure the spark.jars spark option is set to include nessie-iceberg-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (todo link to jar). Note for spark2 use the spark2 artifact. This fat jar has all the required iceberg and Nessie libraries in it. Note there is currently a patch in progress in the iceberg repository to build the Nessie client into iceberg. This should be availabe at the next release of iceberg In pyspark this would look like SparkSession . builder . config ( 'spark.jars' , 'path/to/nessie-iceberg-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' ) ... rest of spark config . getOrCreate () The docs for the Java api in Iceberg explain how to use a Catalog . The only change is that a Nessie catalog should be instantiated Java Catalog catalog = new NessieCatalog ( spark . sparkContext (). hadoopConfiguration ()) Python catalog = jvm . NessieCatalog ( sc . _jsc . hadoopConfiguration ()) Note Iceberg\u2019s python libraries are still under active development. Actions against catalogs in pyspark still have to go through the jvm objects. See the demo directory for details. The Nessie Catalog needs the following parameters set in the Spark/Hadoop config. nessie.url = full url to nessie nessie.username = username if using basic auth, omitted otherwise nessie.password = password if using basic auth, omitted otherwise nessie.auth.type = authentication type (BASIC, NONE or AWS) These are set as follows in code (or through other methods as described here ) Java //for a local spark instance conf . set ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.url\" , url ) . set ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.ref\" , branch ) . set ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.auth_type\" , authType ); spark = SparkSession . builder () . master ( \"local[2]\" ) . config ( conf ) . getOrCreate (); Python # here we are assuming NONE authorisation spark = SparkSession . builder \\ . config ( \"spark.jars\" , \"../../clients/iceberg-spark3/target/nessie-iceberg-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.url\" , \"http://localhost:19120/api/v1\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.ref\" , \"main\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.sql.catalog.nessie\" , \"com.dremio.nessie.iceberg.spark.NessieIcebergSparkCatalog\" ) \\ . getOrCreate () Note above we specified the option spark.hadoop.nessie.ref . This value sets the default branch that the iceberg catalog will use. This can be changed by changing the hadoopConfiguration however best practice would be to use a single write context (branch) for the duration of the spark session. Read context can be changed dynamically as shown below. We have also specified spark.sql.catalog.nessie to point to our NessieIcebergSparkCatalog . This is a Spark3 only option to set the catalog nessie to be managed by Nessie\u2019s Catalog implementation. Writing \u00b6 Spark support is constantly evolving and the differences in Spark3 vs Spark2.4 are considerable. See the iceberg docs for an up to date support table. Spark2 \u00b6 Spark2.4 supports reads, appends, overwrites in Iceberg. Nessie tables in iceberg can be written via the Nessie Iceberg Catalog instantiated above. Iceberg in Spark2.4 has no ability to create tables so before a table can be appended to or overwritten the table must be first created via an Iceberg Catalog. This is straightforward in Java but requires addressing jvm objects directly in Python (until the python library for iceberg is released).

PartitionSpec . unpartitioned () # finally create the table region_table = catalog . createTable ( region_name , region_schema , region_spec ) When looking at the Python code above, lines 1-10 are importing jvm objects into pyspark. Lines 11-25 create the table name, schema and partition spec. These actions will be familiar to seasoned iceberg users and are wholly iceberg operations. Line 28 is where our initial iceberg metadata is finally written to disk and a commit takes place on Nessie. Now that we have created an Iceberg table in nessie we can write to it. The iceberg DataSourceV2 allows for either overwrite or append mode in a standard spark.write . Java regionDf = spark . read (). load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) regionDf . write (). format ( \"iceberg\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). save ( \"testing.region\" ) Python region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"testing.region\" ) Here we simply read a file from the default filesystem and write it to an existing nessie iceberg table. This will trigger a commit on current context\u2019s branch. For the examples above we have performed commits on the branch specified when we set our spark configuration. Had we not specified the context in our spark configuration all operations would have defaulted to the default branch defined by the server. This is a strong pattern for a spark job which is for example writing data as part of a wider ETL job. It will only ever need one context or branch to write to. If however you are running an interactive session and would like to write to a specific branch without changing context the following works as well. Java regionDf = spark . read (). load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) regionDf . write (). format ( \"iceberg\" ). option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). save ( \"testing.region\" ) Python region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"testing.region\" ) Note the extra option clause in the write command. This will ensure the commit happens on the dev branch rather than the default branch. Spark3 \u00b6 The write path for Spark3 is slightly different and easier to work with. These changes haven\u2019t made it to pyspark yet so writing dataframes looks much the same there, including having to create the table. Spark3 table creation/insertion is as follows: Java regionDf = spark . read (). load ( ' data / region . parquet ' ) //create regionDf . writeTo ( \"nessie.testing.region\" ). create () //append regionDf . writeTo ( \"nessie.testing.region\" ). append () //overwrite partition regionDf . writeTo ( \"nessie.testing.region\" ). overwritePartitions () Python # same code as the spark2 section above to create the testing.region table region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"testing.region\" ) SQL CREATE TABLE nessie . testing . city ( C_CITYKEY BIGINT , C_NAME STRING , N_NATIONKEY BIGINT , C_COMMENT STRING ) USING iceberg PARTITIONED BY ( N_NATIONKEY ) -- AS SELECT .. can be added to the sql statement to perform a CTAS INSERT INTO nessie . testing . city VALUES ( 1 , 'a' , 1 , 'comment' ) The full list of operations can be found here . Everything that Iceberg supports the Nessie Iceberg Catalog also supports. Reading \u00b6 Reading is more straightforward between spark 2 and spark 3. We will look at both versions together in this section. To read a Nessie table in iceberg simply: Java regionDf = spark . read (). format ( \"iceberg\" ). load ( \"testing.region\" ) // Spark2 regionDf = spark . table ( \"nessie.testing.region\" ) // Spark3 Python # same code as above to create the testing.region table region_df = spark . read . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region\" ) SQL SELECT * FROM nessie . testing . city -- Spark3 only The examples above all use the default branch defined on initialisation. There are several ways to reference specific branches or hashes from within a read statement. We will take a look at a few now from pyspark3, the rules are the same across all environments though. The general pattern is <table>@<branch> . Table must be present and either branch and/or hash are optional. We will throw an error if branch or hash don\u2019t exist. Branch or hash references in the table name will override passed option s and the settings in the Spark/Hadoop configs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 spark . read () . option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ) . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region\" ) # read from dev branch spark . read () . option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"<hash>\" ) . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region\" ) # read from branch at specific point in time spark . read () . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region@dev\" ) # read from branch dev spark . read () . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region@<hash>\" ) # read specifically from hash spark . sql ( \"SELECT * FROM nessie.testing.`region@dev`\" ) spark . sql ( \"SELECT * FROM nessie.testing.`region@<hash>`\" ) Notice in the SQL statements the table@branch must be escaped separately from namespace or catalog arguments. Future versions may add the ability to specify a timestamp to query the data at a specific point in time (time-travel). In the meantime the history can be viewed on the command line or via the python client and a specific hash based on commit time can be extracted for use in the spark catalog. It is recommended to use the time-travel features of Nessie over the Iceberg features as Nessie history is consistent across the entire database. Delta Lake \u00b6 Note You can follow along interactively in a Jupyter notebook by following the instructions here . Delta Lake support in Nessie requires some minor modifications to the core Delta libraries. This patch is still ongoing, in the meantime Nessie will not work on Databricks and must be used with the open source Delta. The hope that these changes will be accepted for the next release of Delta. Nessie is able to interact with Delta Lake by implementing a custom version of Delta\u2019s LogStore interface . This ensures that all filesystem changes are recorded by Nessie as commits. The benefit of this approach is the core ACID primitives are handled by Nessie. The limitations around concurrency that Delta would normally have are removed, any number of readers and writers can simultaneously interact with a Nessie managed Delta Lake table. The consequence is the Delta table is no longer readable by non-Nessie Delta Lake readers. To access Nessie from a spark cluster make sure the spark.jars spark option is set to include nessie-deltalake-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (todo link to jar). This fat jar has all the required delta and nessie libraries in it. Note the spark3 jar is for Delta versions >7.0 on Spark3 and the spark2 jar is for Delta versions 6.x on Spark2.4 In pyspark this would look like SparkSession . builder . config ( 'spark.jars' , 'path/to/nessie-deltalake-spark-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' ) ... rest of spark config . getOrCreate () The Nessie LogStore needs the following parameters set in the Spark/Hadoop config. nessie.url = full url to nessie nessie.username = username if using basic auth, omitted otherwise nessie.password = password if using basic auth, omitted otherwise nessie.auth.type = authentication type (BASIC, NONE or AWS) spark.delta.logFileHandler.class=com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogFileMetaParser spark.delta.logStore.class=com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogStore These are set as follows in code (or through other methods as described here ) Python # here we are assuming NONE authorisation spark = SparkSession . builder \\ . config ( \"spark.jars\" , \"../../clients/iceberg-spark3/target/nessie-iceberg-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.url\" , \"http://localhost:19120/api/v1\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.ref\" , \"main\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog\" , \"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.sql.extensions\" , \"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.delta.logFileHandler.class\" , \"com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogFileMetaParser\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.delta.logStore.class\" , \"com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogStore\" ) \\ . getOrCreate () Note above we specified the option spark.hadoop.nessie.ref . This value sets the default branch that the iceberg catalog will use. This can be changed by changing the hadoopConfiguration however best practice would be to use a single write context (branch) for the duration of the spark session. The key to enabling Nessie is to instruct Delta to use the Nessie specific LogStore and LogFileHandler . With these enabled the Delta core library will delegate transaction handling to Nessie. Finally, note we have explicitly enabled Delta\u2019s SQL extensions which enable Delta specific SQL in Spark3. Warning Currently Delta metadata operations like VACUUM are descructive to Nessie managed Delta tables. Do not run these operations. Future versions of Nessie will disable these commands when Nessie is activated. Writing \u00b6 Spark support is constantly evolving and the differences in Spark3 vs Spark2.4 is considerable. See the delta docs for an up to date support table. Spark2 \u00b6 Spark2.4 supports reads, appends, overwrites in Delta via data frames. Spark 3 additionally supports SQL syntax. Nessie tables in delta can be written via the Nessi enabled Delta client. The Delta writer allows for either overwrite or append mode in a standard spark.write . Java regionDf = spark . read (). load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) regionDf . write (). format ( \"delta\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). save ( \"/location/to/delta/testing/region\" ) Python region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"delta\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"/location/to/delta/testing/region\" ) === \u201cSQL\u201d CREATE TABLE nessie . testing . city ( C_CITYKEY BIGINT , C_NAME STRING , N_NATIONKEY BIGINT , C_COMMENT STRING ) USING delta PARTITIONED BY ( N_NATIONKEY ) LOCATION 'path/to/delta/testing/city' -- SELECT .. can be added to the sql statement to perform a CTAS INSERT [ OVERWRITE ] INTO nessie . testing . city VALUES ( 1 , 'a' , 1 , 'comment' ) Here we simply read a file from the default filesystem and write it to a new nessie Delta table.

Java spark . sparkContext (). hadoopConfiguration (). set ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ) regionDf = spark . read (). load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) regionDf . write (). format ( \"delta\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). save ( \"/location/to/delta/testing/region\" ) Python spark . sparkContext . _jsc . hadoopConfiguration () . set ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ) region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"delta\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"/location/to/delta/testing/region\" ) SQL -- change hadoop configuration externally using the Java or Python syntax CREATE TABLE nessie . testing . city ( C_CITYKEY BIGINT , C_NAME STRING , N_NATIONKEY BIGINT , C_COMMENT STRING ) USING iceberg PARTITIONED BY ( N_NATIONKEY ) -- AS SELECT .. can be added to the sql statement to perform a CTAS INSERT INTO nessie . testing . city VALUES ( 1 , 'a' , 1 , 'comment' ) We have to manually change the hadoopConfiguration for the SparkContext for a Delta table to be initialised with the correct reference. This will change in the near future when it will be possible to use the same branch@ref syntax as Iceberg inside of delta. Currently it isn\u2019t possible to change the ref from SQL directly. This should be fixed in an upcomming release. Note Delta by default caches tables internally. If an action has to happen on the same table but a different branch the cache first should be cleared. DeltaLog.clearCache() . Reading \u00b6 Reading is similar between Spark2 and Spark3. We will look at both versions together in this section. To read a Nessie table in Delta simply: Java regionDf = spark . read (). format ( \"delta\" ). load ( \"/path/to/delta/testing/region\" ) Python region_df = spark . read . format ( \"delta\" ) . load ( \"/path/to/delta/testing/region\" ) SQL SELECT * FROM '/path/to/delta/testing/region' The examples above all use the default branch defined on initialisation. Future versions will add the ability to specify a branch and timestamp similar to Iceberg. Currently to switch branches a similar technique as writing is required (manually changing the hadoopConfiguration).

Lines 11-25 create the table name, schema and partition spec. These actions will be familiar to seasoned iceberg users and are wholly iceberg operations. Line 28 is where our initial iceberg metadata is finally written to disk and a commit takes place on Nessie. Now that we have created an Iceberg table in nessie we can write to it. The iceberg DataSourceV2 allows for either overwrite or append mode in a standard spark.write . Java regionDf = spark . read (). load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) regionDf . write (). format ( \"iceberg\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). save ( \"testing.region\" ) Python region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"testing.region\" ) Here we simply read a file from the default filesystem and write it to an existing nessie iceberg table. This will trigger a commit on current context\u2019s branch. For the examples above we have performed commits on the branch specified when we set our spark configuration. Had we not specified the context in our spark configuration all operations would have defaulted to the default branch defined by the server. This is a strong pattern for a spark job which is for example writing data as part of a wider ETL job. It will only ever need one context or branch to write to. If however you are running an interactive session and would like to write to a specific branch without changing context the following works as well. Java regionDf = spark . read (). load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) regionDf . write (). format ( \"iceberg\" ). option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). save ( \"testing.region\" ) Python region_df = spark . read . load ( \"data/region.parquet\" ) region_df . write . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . save ( \"testing.region\" ) Note the extra option clause in the write command.

There are several ways to reference specific branches or hashes from within a read statement. We will take a look at a few now from pyspark3, the rules are the same across all environments though. The general pattern is <table>@<branch> . Table must be present and either branch and/or hash are optional. We will throw an error if branch or hash don\u2019t exist. Branch or hash references in the table name will override passed option s and the settings in the Spark/Hadoop configs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 spark . read () . option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"dev\" ) . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region\" ) # read from dev branch spark . read () . option ( \"nessie.ref\" , \"<hash>\" ) . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region\" ) # read from branch at specific point in time spark . read () . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region@dev\" ) # read from branch dev spark . read () . format ( \"iceberg\" ) . load ( \"testing.region@<hash>\" ) # read specifically from hash spark . sql ( \"SELECT * FROM nessie.testing.`region@dev`\" ) spark . sql ( \"SELECT * FROM nessie.testing.`region@<hash>`\" ) Notice in the SQL statements the table@branch must be escaped separately from namespace or catalog arguments. Future versions may add the ability to specify a timestamp to query the data at a specific point in time (time-travel). In the meantime the history can be viewed on the command line or via the python client and a specific hash based on commit time can be extracted for use in the spark catalog. It is recommended to use the time-travel features of Nessie over the Iceberg features as Nessie history is consistent across the entire database.","title":"Reading"},{"location":"tools/spark/#delta-lake","text":"Note You can follow along interactively in a Jupyter notebook by following the instructions here . Delta Lake support in Nessie requires some minor modifications to the core Delta libraries. This patch is still ongoing, in the meantime Nessie will not work on Databricks and must be used with the open source Delta. The hope that these changes will be accepted for the next release of Delta. Nessie is able to interact with Delta Lake by implementing a custom version of Delta\u2019s LogStore interface . This ensures that all filesystem changes are recorded by Nessie as commits. The benefit of this approach is the core ACID primitives are handled by Nessie. The limitations around concurrency that Delta would normally have are removed, any number of readers and writers can simultaneously interact with a Nessie managed Delta Lake table. The consequence is the Delta table is no longer readable by non-Nessie Delta Lake readers. To access Nessie from a spark cluster make sure the spark.jars spark option is set to include nessie-deltalake-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (todo link to jar). This fat jar has all the required delta and nessie libraries in it. Note the spark3 jar is for Delta versions >7.0 on Spark3 and the spark2 jar is for Delta versions 6.x on Spark2.4 In pyspark this would look like SparkSession . builder . config ( 'spark.jars' , 'path/to/nessie-deltalake-spark-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' ) ... rest of spark config . getOrCreate () The Nessie LogStore needs the following parameters set in the Spark/Hadoop config. nessie.url = full url to nessie nessie.username = username if using basic auth, omitted otherwise nessie.password = password if using basic auth, omitted otherwise nessie.auth.type = authentication type (BASIC, NONE or AWS) spark.delta.logFileHandler.class=com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogFileMetaParser spark.delta.logStore.class=com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogStore These are set as follows in code (or through other methods as described here ) Python # here we are assuming NONE authorisation spark = SparkSession . builder \\ . config ( \"spark.jars\" , \"../../clients/iceberg-spark3/target/nessie-iceberg-spark3-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.url\" , \"http://localhost:19120/api/v1\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.hadoop.nessie.ref\" , \"main\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog\" , \"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.sql.extensions\" , \"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.delta.logFileHandler.class\" , \"com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogFileMetaParser\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.delta.logStore.class\" , \"com.dremio.nessie.deltalake.NessieLogStore\" ) \\ . getOrCreate () Note above we specified the option spark.hadoop.nessie.ref . This value sets the default branch that the iceberg catalog will use. This can be changed by changing the hadoopConfiguration however best practice would be to use a single write context (branch) for the duration of the spark session. The key to enabling Nessie is to instruct Delta to use the Nessie specific LogStore and LogFileHandler . With these enabled the Delta core library will delegate transaction handling to Nessie. Finally, note we have explicitly enabled Delta\u2019s SQL extensions which enable Delta specific SQL in Spark3.

Future versions of Nessie will disable these commands when Nessie is activated.","title":"Delta Lake"},{"location":"tools/spark/#writing_1","text":"Spark support is constantly evolving and the differences in Spark3 vs Spark2.4 is considerable.
