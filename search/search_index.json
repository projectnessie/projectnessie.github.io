So the team decided that the \u201cglobal state\u201d can go away. This was implemented in the Nessie PR #3866. Since that change reduced the amount of global-log-entries to nearly 0, we could also get rid of the fact that every single change to the Nessie repository, even creating a branch or tag, creates a potentially empty global-log-entry. Not writing unnecessary global-log-entries was implemented in the Nessie PR #3909. Both PRs, 3866 and 3909, were released together as Nessie 0.26.0. All Nessie tests were passing and nobody realised that a little devil sneaked into these code changes, waiting to be woken up in production.</p> <p>The situation that the global-pointer contains a \u201cbroken\u201d list of global-log parent IDs is definitely confusing and cannot be explained by only looking at the code base of the target 0.26.0 release.

First, it served as the \u201ccondition field\u201d for the CAS<sup>1</sup> operation. The same field <code>global_id</code> also pointed to the HEAD of the global-log. PR #3909 changed this. The <code>global_id</code> field only serves as the \u201ccondition field\u201d for the CAS operation, the HEAD of the global log is held in <code>global_log_head</code>. Since <code>global_id</code> is no longer related to the HEAD of the global log, its value is a random value.</p> <p>As you may already guess, if a Nessie version before PR #3909 performs an update, it interprets the value of <code>global_id</code> as the HEAD of the global log. The linked part of the code then evaluates this if-condition to true, which is some other backwards compatibility code, and fills the list of global-log parents only with the value of <code>global_id</code>, because <code>currentEntry</code> is always <code>null</code>, because <code>global_id</code> does not point to a global log entry.</p> <p>Later, the function updateGlobalStatePointer populates the list of global-log-entries with the ID of the new global-log-entry and the collected parents, which is just that random global-id.

The rise of very large metadata and eventually consistent cloud data lakes (S3 specifically) drove the need for an updated model around metadata management. Where consistent directory listings in HDFS used to be sufficient, there were many features lacking. This includes snapshotting, consistency and fast planning. Apache Iceberg was created to help alleviate those problems.</p> <p>For more insight into why we created Nessie, you can read the founding blog post by one of Nessie\u2019s creators.</p>"},{"location":"develop/#inspiration","title":"Inspiration","text":"<p>The Iceberg format relies on a set of metadata files stored with (or near) the actual data tables. This allows Iceberg to fulfill the same role as the Hive Metastore for transactions without the need for expensive metadata scans or centralized planning (see Iceberg performance). This includes things such as partitioning (including hidden partitions), schema migrations, appends and deletes.  It does however require a pointer to the active metadata set to function. This pointer allows the Iceberg client to acquire and read the current schema, files and partitions in the dataset. Iceberg currently relies on the Hive metastore or hdfs to perform this role. The requirements for this root pointer store is it must hold (at least) information about the location of the current up-to-date metadata file, and it must be able to update this location atomically. In Hive this is accomplished by locks and in hdfs by using atomic file swap operations. These operations don\u2019t exist in eventually consistent cloud object stores, necessitating a Hive metastore for cloud data lakes. The Nessie system is designed to store the root metadata pointer and perform atomic updates to this pointer, obviating the need for a Hive metastore. Removing the need for a Hive metastore simplifies deployment and broadens the reach of tools that can work with Iceberg tables.</p> <p>The Nessie service is a lightweight Java-based REST API server. It uses a standard optimistic locking strategy to ensure atomic transactions. This relies on every operation carrying an expected hash state for the store and allows for a very light weight and scalable implementation. The implementation uses configurable authentication (e.g. IAM on AWS, JWT elsewhere) and a configurable backend (currently supporting RocksDB for single-node, and Apache Cassandra, ScyllaDB, Google BigTable, Amazon DynamoDB or MongoDB) and uses the optimistic locking features of cloud based key value stores to ensure scalability across servers.

When talking about Cloud Data ops, everyone does not get their own copy of data\u2013the datasets are typically large and centralized. Because Nessie is layered on top of those shared datasets, clones make less sense. In the Nessie world, using personal branches provides a similar mechanism while keeping a shared world view of what can be managed for GC policies, etc. Speed (commits/second)) &lt;1 hundreds to thousands When we started working on Nessie, we actually tried to use Git. We evaluated Git directly, implemented a version that used JGit (used by tools like Gerrit and Eclipse) as well as explored the capabilities of GitHub, Azure Git and AWS Git. What we saw was a fairly expensive operation. Typically, a single commit operation took on the order of a few seconds. Scale 100s MB Unconstrained While there are multiple examples of larger or higher performance Git implementations (1, 2) , in general Git repositories are fairly small in size. Things like Git LFS were created to help accommodate this but given the nature of clones, large repositories are frowned upon. Because Nessie provides a centralized repository, typical repository constraints do not apply. History Thousands Billions Nessie supports optional garbage collection of historical commits based on user-defined rules to reduce storage consumption. Committer Human Human &amp; Machine Git was designed for human time: commits happen 100-1000s of times a day, not 100x per second. Data in many systems is changing very frequently (especially when you consider a large number of tables). These systems are frequently driven by automated scripts Objects Files Tables &amp; Views Nessie is focused on tracking versions of tables using a well-known set of open table formats.

(For reference, the  5 minutes comes from community guidance on commit speed per table for Iceberg. The  100,000 tables comes from various users we\u2019ve worked with before.)

Files that are not contained in the    set of file-references are going to be deleted. Deletion either happens immediately or is    persisted in the live-content-set as a set of orphan files. 3.

For Keycloak, this is    typically the realm URL: <code>https://&lt;keycloak-server&gt;/realms/&lt;realm-name&gt;</code>. Optional. Either this    property or the <code>authentication.oauth2.token-endpoint</code> property must be provided. Endpoint    discovery is performed using the OpenID Connect Discovery metadata published by the issuer.    See OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.token-endpoint</code>: the URL of the OAuth2 token endpoint. For Keycloak, this    is typically <code>https://&lt;keycloak-server&gt;/realms/&lt;realm-name&gt;/protocol/openid-connect/token</code>.    Optional. Either this property or the <code>authentication.oauth2.issuer-url</code> property must be    provided.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.auth-endpoint</code>: the URL of the OAuth2 auth endpoint. For Keycloak, this is    typically <code>https://&lt;keycloak-server&gt;/realms/&lt;realm-name&gt;/protocol/openid-connect/auth</code>. If using    the \u201cauthorization_code\u201d grant type, either this property or the    <code>authentication.oauth2.issuer-url</code> property must be provided.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.device-auth-endpoint</code>: the URL of the OAuth2 device auth endpoint. For    Keycloak, this is typically    <code>https://&lt;keycloak-server&gt;/realms/&lt;realm-name&gt;/protocol/openid-connect/auth/device</code>. If using    the \u201cdevice_code\u201d grant type, either this property or the <code>authentication.oauth2.issuer-url</code>    property must be provided.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.client-id</code>: the client ID to use when authenticating against the OAuth2   server. Required.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.client-secret</code>: the client secret to use when authenticating against the   OAuth2 server. Required.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.username</code>: the username to use when authenticating against the OAuth2   server. Required if using the \u201cpassword\u201d grant type.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.password</code>: the password to use when authenticating against the OAuth2   server. Required if using the \u201cpassword\u201d grant type.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.default-access-token-lifespan</code>: the default access token lifespan; if the   OAuth2 server returns an access token without specifying its expiration time, this value will be   used. Optional, defaults to <code>PT1M</code> (1 minute). Must be a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.default-refresh-token-lifespan</code>: the default refresh token lifespan;   if the OAuth2 server returns a refresh token without specifying its expiration time, this value   will be used. Optional, defaults to <code>PT30M</code> (30 minutes). Must be a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.refresh-safety-window</code>: the refresh safety window to use; a new token will   be fetched when the current token\u2019s remaining lifespan is less than this value. Optional, defaults   to <code>PT10S</code> (10 seconds). Must be a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.client-scopes</code>: space-separated list of scopes to include in each request   to the OAuth2 server. Optional, defaults to empty (no scopes). The scope names will not be   validated by the Nessie client; make sure they are valid according to RFC 6749 Section 3.3.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.token-exchange-enabled</code>: if set to <code>true</code>, the Nessie client will attempt   to exchange access tokens for refresh tokens whenever appropriate. This, however, can only work if   the OAuth2 server supports token exchange. Optional, defaults to <code>true</code> (enabled). Note that   recent versions of Keycloak support token exchange, but it is disabled by default. See Using   token exchange for more information and how to enable this feature.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.preemptive-token-refresh-idle-timeout</code>: for how long the Nessie    client should keep the tokens fresh, if the client is not being actively used. Setting this value    too high may cause an excessive usage of network I/O and thread resources; conversely, when    setting it too low, if the client is used again, the calling thread may block if the tokens are    expired and need to be renewed synchronously. Optional, defaults to <code>PT30S</code> (30 seconds). Must be    a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.background-thread-idle-timeout</code>: how long the Nessie client should    keep a background thread alive, if the client is not being actively used, or no token refreshes    are being executed. Setting this value too high will cause the background thread to keep running    even if the client is not used anymore, potentially leaking thread and memory resources;    conversely, setting it too low could cause the background thread to be restarted too often.   Optional, defaults to <code>PT30S</code> (30 seconds). Must be a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.auth-code-flow.web-port</code>: The port used for the embedded web server    that listens for the authorization code callback. This is only used if the grant type to use is    \u201cauthorization_code\u201d. Optional; if not present, a random port will be used.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.auth-code-flow.timeout</code>: How long the client should wait for the   authorization code flow to complete. This is only used if the grant type to use is   \u201cauthorization_code\u201d. Optional, defaults to <code>PT5M</code> (5 minutes). Must be a valid    ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.device-code-flow.timeout</code>: How long the client should wait for the   device code flow to complete. This is only used if the grant type to use is   \u201cdevice_code\u201d. Optional, defaults to <code>PT5M</code> (5 minutes). Must be a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>authentication.oauth2.device-code-flow.poll-interval</code>: How often the client should poll the    device authorization endpoint for a token. This is only used if the grant type to use is   \u201cdevice_code\u201d. Optional, defaults to <code>PT5S</code> (5 seconds). Must be a valid ISO-8601 duration.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tools/client_config/#which-grant-type-to-use","title":"Which grant type to use?","text":"<p>The \u201cclient_credentials\u201d grant type is the simplest one, but it requires the client to be granted enough permissions to access the Nessie server on behalf of the user. This is not always possible, and should be avoided if the resource owner (the user) is a human.</p> <p>The \u201cpassword\u201d grant type is also simple, but it requires passing the user\u2019s password to the client, which may not be acceptable in some cases for security reasons.</p> <p>For real users trying to authenticate within a terminal session, such as a Spark shell, the \u201cauthorization_code\u201d grant type is recommended. It requires the user to authenticate in a browser window, thus sparing the need to provide the user\u2019s password directly to the client. The user will  be prompted to authenticate in a separate browser window, and the Nessie client will be notified  when the authentication is complete.</p> <p>If the terminal session is running remotely however, on inside an embedded device, then the \u201cauthorization_code\u201d grant type may not be suitable, as the browser and the terminal session must  be running on the same machine. In this case, the \u201cdevice_code\u201d grant type is recommended. Similar  to the \u201cauthorization_code\u201d grant type, it requires the user to authenticate in a browser window,  but it does not require the browser and the terminal session to be running on the same machine.
